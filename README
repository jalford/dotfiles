These are my dotfiles.

They use vcprompt (http://vc.gerg.ca/hg/vcprompt/) which goes in:
	~/bin/vcprompt

The easiest way to install vcprompt is using Homebrew.


~/.bashrc contains one line:
	. ~/bin/dotfiles/bashrc

	
~/.bash_profile just calls ~/.bashrc:
	if [ -f ~/.bashrc ];
	then
	        source ~/.bashrc
	fi

After making changes, run:
 	source ~/.bashrc
